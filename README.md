# Keybinds
> **Keybinds are fully customizable using the game's built in controls settings, courtesy BlueberryWolfiAPIs**

- **`F4` Key**  
	- Opens my stamp menu executable or brings it to the front.

- **`PLUS` Key (+)**  
	- Spawns a stamp at the cursor position.  
	- Spawns a stamp at the player position if `SHIFT` is held.  
	- Spawns a stamp at the dock if `CTRL` is held.  
	- Spawns a stamp on **Canvas 1**, **Canvas 2**, **Canvas 3**, or **Canvas 4** if combined with `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, respectively.

- **`Minus` Key (-)**  
	- Toggles multiframe playback if a GIF/Video has been placed down.  
	- When `SHIFT` is held, toggles playback speed instead.  
	- When `CTRL` is held, resets GIF/Video to play from frame one.

- **`BACKSPACE` Key**  
	- Works as **Ctrl+Z**, undoing the last placed stamps in order.



# General Information
- You can **paste images** into the menu directly or **select a file**
- Supports art saving and image generation if using [chalks](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/hostileonion/chalks/) by the wonderful hostileonion
- Stamps are automatically adjusted to be **upright relative to the player camera**
- you might get temporarily kicked for spawning canvases in cove servers (they are considered an illegal actor)
- In-game canvases have a **200x200** resolution. I recommend **keeping stamps below this size**
- **Off-canvas**: a maximum of four chalk canvases (200*200) can be placed
- Saved stamps are located at `/home/user/.local/share/webfishing_stamps_mod` on Linux or `%localappdata%/webfishing_stamps_mod` on Windows
- **DONT** move when placing gifs down
- Be mindful of **performance and lag**, especially if playing GIFs. This is a **server side mod**, and people play on potatoes
- I recommend installing the **Calico mod**! (it can cause stuttering with gifs though)
- Please dont use Thunderstore Mod Manager

# Image Processing Guide

Here’s a quick overview of how to process your images:

- **Color Match**  
  A simple, reliable option that maps each pixel to the closest chalk color. If you're unsure where to start, pick this for clean, predictable results.

- **K-Means Mapping**  
  Groups similar colors into clusters. Great for noise reduction and simplifying complex images. Adjust the number of clusters to control how stylized the result looks.

- **Dithering**  
  If your image has colors that don’t neatly match the available chalk palette, dithering can help fill those gaps. It creates patterns or “noise” to transition between colors smoothly. There are many dithering methods (Atkinson, Floyd, Jarvis, etc.)—each one handles color transitions differently. Generally:
  - **Hybrid Dither** automatically switches between methods for mixed textures.
  - **Pattern Dither** creates a retro, pixel-art style.
  - **Random Dither** adds noise for a more natural, hand-drawn look.  

Ultimately, you should **experiment** with different methods to find the style that best fits your image!

---

### **Color Options**
Choose what chalk colors to use by **enabling** or **disabling** them.

- Use **RGB** to map an image’s colors to RGB chalk.  
- Use **Blank** to make certain colors fully transparent.
- Use **Placing on Canvas** or **Placing on Grass** to add that color to available colors for increased color accuracy.

### **What is LAB and When to Use It?**

>**LAB** is a color space that better reflects how humans perceive color, improving the accuracy of color matching compared to RGB.

- **Turn LAB On**: For images with subtle gradients or color shifts where precise matching matters.  
- **Turn LAB Off**: For bold, flat colors... I think? If the blues are looking a little too red... 

Basically, if you aren't happy with a result, try turning it off! It's on by default but not always better :3
