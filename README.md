## Keybinds
> **Keybinds are fully customizable using the game's built in controls settings with BlueberryWolfiAPIs**

- **`F9` Key**  
  - Opens my stamp menu executable.

- **`PLUS` Key (+)**  
  - Spawns a stamp at the cursor position.
  - Spawns a stamp at the player position if `SHIFT` is held.
  - Spawns a stamp at the dock if `CTRL` is held.

- **`Minus` Key (-)**  
  - Toggles GIF playback if a GIF has been placed down.

- **`BACKSPACE` Key**  
  - Works as **Ctrl+Z**, undoing the last placed stamps in order.


## General Information
- **`WILL FAIL TO DOWNLOAD PROPERLY`** if using McAfee Scanner, SecureAge, VirIT, or Zillya antivirus (no it's **not a virus** lol)
- The stamps menu might take a moment to launch the first time
- You can **paste images** into the menu directly or **select a file**
- Images are automatically adjusted to be **upright relative to the player camera**
- In-game canvases have a **200x200** resolution. I recommend **keeping stamps below this size**
- **Off-canvas**: a maximum of four chalk canvases (200*200) can be placed
- saved stamps are located at %appdata%/local/webfishing_stamp_mod or whatever the fuck it's called on Linux
- Be mindful of **performance and lag**, especially when playing GIFs. This is a **server side mod**, and people play on potatoes
